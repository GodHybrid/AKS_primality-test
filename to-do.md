## Items

-Items can crafted by hand at high price or found in specific mod-related chests and lockboxes.\
-All items are consumable and provide permanent buffs or boosts to the character.\
-Items have a specific amount of various ingredients to craft with: common - 4 ingredients, uncommon - 6, rare - 8.\
-Usable items are not craftable (found in chests? Rare drop? There should definitely be a limit on how many a player can carry. Use time limitation can be a debuff akin to Potion Sickness)\
-Items have a use cap after which they become unusable. (Remove the cap but give diminishing upgrades?)\

**All items need their sprites/effects redrawn/resized to fit Terraria's aesthetic**
